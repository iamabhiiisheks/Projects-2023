#Price Prediction Using ML 
This project provides a strong foundation for real estate price prediction, and further
refinement and exploration of features could yield even more accurate predictions. The
insights gained from this analysis contribute to a better understanding of the factors
influencing real estate prices in the given context.

                We also used different python packages like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib etc.
For importing the dataset, and also for doing data pre-processing we used pandas. For
doing exploratory data analysis we used matplotlib package in python.

                This model further helps people understand whether this place is more
suited for them based on heatmap correlation. It also helps people looking to sell a house
at best time for greater profit.
